# N5 OS Naming Conventions

## Purpose
Establish human-readable, greppable naming for executions, files, and folders to improve organization, searchability, and consistency in N5 OS.

## Rules
1. **Human-Readable Names**: Use descriptive names derived from content (e.g., plan titles), followed by timestamps for uniqueness (e.g., `exec_hello_world_test_20250920_073731`).
2. **Greppable**: Names should use underscores for spaces, lowercase, and include keywords for easy grep searches (e.g., search for "hello_world" or "test").
3. **Fallback**: If no title is found, use a generic prefix like "execution_" + timestamp.
4. **Consistency**: All files within an execution folder retain original names for traceability.
5. **Future Extensions**: Add metadata tags in file content for better indexing (e.g., YAML frontmatter).
6. **General File Naming**: Use kebab-case for multi-word filenames (e.g., `naming-conventions.md`), except in execution folders where underscores are preferred for grep.
7. **Folder Structure**: Keep related files grouped; use subfolders for categories like plans/, aars/, etc.

This ensures the system is greppable on-site and user-friendly. Reference `file N5.md` for OS context.
